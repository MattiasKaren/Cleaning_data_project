# Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data course

This is my submission for the Week 4 Course Project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course. 
It contains:

# Code file:
The file run_analysis.R contains the R script that produces as clean and tidy data set as per the five steps of the assignement instructions. 

1. It reads all the data frames into R, then merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. It renames the columns to use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. It labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. It creates a independent tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair. It also writes a final output file named tidydata.txt 

# Code book file:
The code book describes all the variables in the data set along with the transformations performeced to create a tidy data set. 
I used the Data Maid package to create the summaries of the variables.
